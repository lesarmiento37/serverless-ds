# Serverless Framework Presentation

## Overview
This document provides the structure and key points for a 45-minute presentation on the Serverless Framework, specifically within AWS. The session includes an introduction to serverless technology, a hands-on demonstration of a serverless architecture, and deployment via AWS CodeBuild using a `buildspec.yaml` file. The live demo will feature a Step Function triggered by S3 bucket events, involving Lambda functions that write to and read from a DynamoDB table.

## Agenda and Timing

### 1. Introduction to Serverless Technology (5 minutes)
- **Definition of Serverless**:
  - Explanation of the serverless model, where cloud providers manage the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on code.
- **Benefits of Serverless**:
  - **Automatic Scaling**: Adapts to load without manual intervention.
  - **Pay-As-You-Go Billing**: Charges are based on invocations and runtime, reducing idle costs.
  - **Reduced Operational Complexity**: Developers manage only the code, not the infrastructure.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - **Event Processing**: Real-time data streams, IoT, etc.
  - **Microservices**: Functions can be structured as independent services.
  - **Stateless Backends**: APIs and other backend functions.
  - **Real-Time Data Processing**: Efficient processing and transformation of data in real-time.

### 2. Serverless on AWS (5 minutes)
- **Key AWS Serverless Services**:
  - **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for running code in response to events, triggers, or requests.
  - **AWS Step Functions**: Managed service to orchestrate workflows and microservices.
  - **Amazon S3**: Object storage service with event triggers for starting workflows.
  - **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database managed by AWS, ideal for serverless applications.
- **Benefits of Using Serverless on AWS**:
  - **Seamless Integration**: Native interoperability among AWS services.
  - **Complete Ecosystem**: Broad support for diverse serverless needs within a single platform.

### 3. Introduction to the Serverless Framework (5 minutes)
- **What is the Serverless Framework?**
  - An open-source tool designed to simplify the development, deployment, and management of serverless applications.
  - Multi-platform support, with this presentation focused on AWS.
- **Key Capabilities**:
  - **Simplified Deployment**: Easily deploys Lambda functions and related serverless resources.
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Serverless applications and infrastructure are defined in code for consistency and versioning.
- **Serverless Framework Structure**:
  - Folder and file layout.
  - Basic overview of `serverless.yml` configuration, including functions, resources, and environment settings.

### 4. Serverless Framework Plugins (5 minutes)
- **Purpose of Plugins**:
  - Extend framework functionality to support various services and use cases.
- **Examples of Useful Plugins**:
  - **VPC Plugin**: Allows deployment of Lambda functions within VPC subnets for secure networking.
  - **DynamoDB Plugin**: Facilitates automated setup and configuration of DynamoDB tables.
  - **Additional Plugins**: Plugins for testing, debugging, and CI/CD integration, expanding framework capabilities.

### 5. Deploying Within a VPC Using Serverless Framework (5 minutes)
- **Motivation for Deploying in a VPC**:
  - **Enhanced Security**: Isolation of resources from the public internet.
  - **Direct Connectivity**: Direct access to databases and other internal AWS resources within the VPC.
- **Configuring a VPC in Serverless Framework**:
  - Example of configuring subnets and security groups in `serverless.yml`:
    ```yaml
    provider:
      name: aws
      runtime: python3.8
      vpc:
        securityGroupIds:
          - sg-123456
        subnetIds:
          - subnet-abcde
          - subnet-fghij
    ```
  - **Considerations**:
    - Increased latency for Lambda cold starts within VPCs.
    - Adjusting permissions and networking for Lambda functions within private subnets.

### 6. Deployment Automation with AWS CodeBuild (5 minutes)
- **Setting Up AWS CodeBuild**:
  - **Using `buildspec.yaml`**: Define the build and deployment steps in CodeBuild.
  - **Serverless Framework Integration**: Run `serverless deploy` as part of the CodeBuild pipeline.
- **Basic `buildspec.yaml` Example**:
  ```yaml
  version: 0.2
  phases:
    install:
      commands:
        - npm install -g serverless
    build:
      commands:
        - serverless deploy
### 7. Proposed Architecture
